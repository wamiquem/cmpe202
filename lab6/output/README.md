Used Strategy Pattern to implement this solution
PrintReceiptStrategy class for printing receipt and PrintPackingSlipStrategy class for printing packing slip. Strategy change is implemeted in the Composite class.

Also, I have used Composite pattern for burger toppings and custom burgers.

The client class calls Composite class object to set the strategy.
