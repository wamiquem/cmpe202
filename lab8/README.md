1. I have used the **Decorator Pattern** to handle display changes as we are adding number digits to card components. As the display is changing at run time, **Decorator Pattern** is the most elegant way to achieve this by wrapping the cardnumber and cardexp objects inside the CardNumberDecorator object and CardExpDecorator respectively. Decorators add additional behavior to objects at runtime, additional behavior here for example is adding " " to card number after every block of 4 digits.
2. I have created the decorator object and wrapped the object to be decorated in App.java and used these objects to add as subcomponents in the Screen class, so this is **Composite Pattern** as before. The Credit Card Text Entry is getting handled using **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**.
3. I am handling backspace(X or x), in the App.java class by first calling key(ch, count) method of screen class and then decreasing the total count of digits entered. Then inside the CreditCardNumber, CreditCardExp and CreditCardCVC classes, I am deleting the last number if 'X' or 'x' is pressed.
